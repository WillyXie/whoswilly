<p>
  Welcome to my little corner of the website
  where I share my notes, projects, and explorations of things that
  interest me. For the very first, let me do a brief introduction
  about myself. &#128583;<br/>
  
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.ncku.edu.tw/" target="_blank">
  NCKU (National Cheng Kung University)</a> with my master degree in
  Electronic Engineering. My research experience spans CPU 
  micro-architecture, CNN accelerator, and SoC design. I'm deeply 
  fascinated by computer architecture and system design, and I enjoy 
  collaborating on challenging objects.<br/>
  
  I currently work as a CPU verification engineer at Google Silicon.
  I'm passionate about computer architecture and pursue related
  research and side projects. In my free time, I enjoy working out at
  the gym to balance my love of Taiwanese cuisine. I'm also learning 
  to snowboard, as I enjoy winter traveling and the stunning mountain
  scenery.<br/>
