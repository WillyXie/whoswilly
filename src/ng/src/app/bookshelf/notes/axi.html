A1.2 AXI Architecture
The AXI protocol is transactions-based and defines five independent channels:
• Write request, which has signal names beginning with AW.
• Write data, which has signal names beginning with W.
• Write response, which has signal names beginning with B.
• Read request, which has signal names beginning with AR.
• Read data, which has signal names beginning with R.

A request channel carries control information that describes the nature of the data to be transferred. This is known
as a request.

The AXI protocol:
• Permits address information to be issued ahead of the actual data transfer.
• Supports multiple outstanding transactions.
• Supports out-of-order completion of transactions.

A1.2.2 Interface and interconnect
The AXI protocol provides a single interface definition for the interfaces between:
• A Manager and the interconnect
• A Subordinate and the interconnect
• A Manager and a Subordinate

This interface definition supports many different interconnect implementations.
An interconnect between devices is equivalent to another device with symmetrical Manager and Subordinate ports
that the real Manager and Subordinate devices can be connected.

A1.3.2 AXI transactions and transfers
An AXI transfer is the communication in one cycle on an AXI channel.
An AXI transaction is the set of transfers required for an AXI Manager to communicate with an AXI Subordinate.
For example, a read transaction consists of a request transfer and one or more read data transfers.

A3 AXI Transport
A3.1.1 Clock
Each AXI interface has a single clock signal, ACLK. All input signals are sampled on the rising edge of ACLK.
All output signal changes can only occur after the rising edge of ACLK.
On Manager and Subordinate interfaces, there must be no combinatorial paths between input and output signals.

A3.1.2 Reset
The AXI protocol uses a single active-LOW reset signal, ARESETn. The reset signal can be asserted
asynchronously, but deassertion can only be synchronous with a rising edge of ACLK.
During reset the following interface requirements apply:
• A Manager interface must drive AWVALID, WVALID, and ARVALID LOW.
• A Subordinate interface must drive BVALID and RVALID LOW.
• All other signals can be driven to any value.
The earliest point after reset that a Manager is permitted to begin driving AWVALID, WVALID, or ARVALID
HIGH is at a rising ACLK edge after ARESETn is HIGH.

A3.2 Channel handshake
The source generates the VALID signal to indicate
when the address, data, or control information is available. The destination generates the READY signal to
indicate that it can accept the information. Transfer occurs only when both the VALID and READY signals are
HIGH.

A source is not permitted to wait until READY is asserted before asserting VALID.
When VALID is asserted, it must remain asserted until the handshake occurs, at a rising clock edge when VALID
and READY are both asserted.

A destination is permitted to wait for VALID to be asserted before asserting the corresponding READY.
If READY is asserted, it is permitted to deassert READY before VALID is asserted.

A3.3 Write and read channels
A3.3.2 Write data channel (W)
A Subordinate that does not use WLAST can omit the input from its interface.
The property WLAST_Present is used to determine if the WLAST signal is present.

A3.3.5 Read data channel(R)
A Manager that does not use RLAST can omit the input from its interface.
The property RLAST_Present is used to determine if the RLAST signal is present.

A3.4 Relationships between the channels
The AXI protocol requires the following relationships to be maintained:
• A write response must always follow the last write transfer in a write transaction.
• Read data and responses must always follow the read request.
• Channel handshakes must conform to the dependencies defined in A3.5 Dependencies between channel
handshake signals.
• When a Manager issues a write request, it must be able to provide all write data for that transaction, without
dependency on other transactions from that Manager.
• When a Manager has issued a write request and all write data, it must be able to accept all responses for that
transaction, without dependency on other transactions from that Manager.
• When a Manager has issued a read request, it must be able to accept all read data for that transaction, without
dependency on other transactions from that Manager.
– Note that a Manager can rely on read data returning in order from transactions that use the same ID, so
the Manager only needs enough storage for read data from transactions with different IDs.
• A Manager is permitted to wait for one transaction to complete before issuing another transaction request.
• A Subordinate is permitted to wait for one transaction to complete before accepting or issuing transfers for
another transaction.
• A Subordinate must not block acceptance of data-less write requests due to transactions with leading write
data.

A3.5 Dependencies between channel handshake signals
A3.5.1 Write transaction dependencies
For transactions on the write channels, Figure A3.5 shows the handshake signal dependencies. The rules are:
• The Manager must not wait for the Subordinate to assert AWREADY or WREADY before asserting
AWVALID or WVALID. This applies to every write data transfer in a transaction.
• The Subordinate can wait for AWVALID or WVALID, or both, before asserting AWREADY.
• The Subordinate can assert AWREADY before AWVALID or WVALID, or both, are asserted.
• The Subordinate can wait for AWVALID or WVALID, or both, before asserting WREADY.
• The Subordinate can assert WREADY before AWVALID or WVALID, or both, are asserted.
• The Subordinate must wait for AWVALID, AWREADY, WVALID, and WREADY to be asserted before
asserting BVALID.
• The Subordinate must also wait for WLAST to be asserted before asserting BVALID. This wait is because
the write response, BRESP, must be signaled only after the last data transfer of a write transaction.
• The Subordinate must not wait for the Manager to assert BREADY before asserting BVALID.
• The Manager can wait for BVALID before asserting BREADY.
• The Manager can assert BREADY before BVALID is asserted.

A3.5.2 Read transaction dependencies
• The Manager must not wait for the Subordinate to assert ARREADY before asserting ARVALID.
• The Subordinate can wait for ARVALID to be asserted before it asserts ARREADY.
• The Subordinate can assert ARREADY before ARVALID is asserted.
• The Subordinate must wait for both ARVALID and ARREADY to be asserted before it asserts RVALID to
indicate that valid data is available.
• The Subordinate must not wait for the Manager to assert RREADY before asserting RVALID.
• The Manager can wait for RVALID to be asserted before it asserts RREADY.
• The Manager can assert RREADY before RVALID is asserted.

A3.6.3 Snoop transaction dependencies
• The Subordinate must not wait for the Manager to assert ACREADY before asserting ACVALID.
• The Manager can wait for ACVALID to be asserted before it asserts ACREADY.
• The Manager can assert ACREADY before ACVALID is asserted.
• The Manager must wait for both ACVALID and ACREADY to be asserted before it asserts CRVALID to
indicate that a valid response is available.
• The Manager must not wait for the Subordinate to assert CRREADY before asserting CRVALID.
• The Subordinate can wait for CRVALID to be asserted before it asserts CRREADY.
• The Subordinate can assert CRREADY before CRVALID is asserted.

A4 AXI Transactions
A4.1 Transaction request
A transaction must not cross a 4KB address boundary. This prevents a transaction from crossing a boundary
between two Subordinates. It also limits the number of address increments that a Subordinate must support.
A4.1.1 Size attribute
Size indicates the maximum number of bytes in each data transfer.
For read transactions, Size indicates how many data bytes must be valid in each read data transfer.
For write transactions, Size indicates how many data byte lanes are permitted to be active. The write strobes
indicate which of those bytes are valid in each transfer.
The property SIZE_Present is used to determine if the AxSIZE signals are present.

A4.1.2 Length attribute
The Length attribute defines the number of data transfers in a transaction.
The property LEN_Present is used to determine if the signals are present.
The following rules apply to transaction Length:
• For wrapping bursts, Length can be 2, 4, 8, or 16.
• For fixed bursts, Length can be up to 16.
• A transaction must not cross a 4KB address boundary.
• Early termination of transactions is not supported.
A4.1.3 Maximum number of bytes in a transaction
The maximum number of bytes in a transaction is 4KB and transactions are not permitted to cross a 4KB boundary.
The property Max_Transaction_Bytes defines the maximum size of a transaction in bytes as shown in Table A4.6.
When connecting Manager and Subordinate interfaces, Max_transaction_Bytes of Manager larger than Subordinate is
not compatible.

A4.1.4 Burst attribute
The Burst attribute describes how the address increments between transfers in a transaction.
FIXED
This Burst type is used for repeated accesses to the same location such as when loading or emptying a FIFO.
• The address is the same for every transfer in the burst.
• The byte lanes that are valid are constant for all transfers. However, within those byte lanes, the actual bytes
that have WSTRB asserted can differ for each transfer.
• The Length of the burst can be up to 16 transfers.
• The FIXED burst type can only be used with WriteNoSnoop or ReadNoSnoop Opcodes. See Chapter A8
Request Opcodes for more information.

INCR (incrementing)
With this Burst type, the address for each transfer is an increment of the address for the previous transfer. The
increment value depends on the transaction Size.

WRAP (wrapping)
This Burst type is similar to INCR except that the address wraps around to a lower address if an upper address
limit is reached. The following restrictions apply:
• The start address must be aligned to the size of each transfer.
• The Length of the burst must be 2, 4, 8, or 16 transfers.

The behavior of a wrapping transaction is:
• The lowest address accessed by the transaction is the start address aligned to the total size of the data to be
transferred, that is Size * Length. This address is defined as the wrap boundary.
• After each transfer, the address increments in the same way as for an INCR burst. However, if this
incremented address is ((wrap boundary)+ (Size * Length)), then the address wraps round to the
wrap boundary.
• The first transfer in the transaction can use an address that is higher than the wrap boundary, subject to the
restrictions that apply to wrapping transactions. The address wraps when the first address is higher than the
wrap boundary. This Burst type is used for cache line accesses.

The property BURST_Present is used to determine if the AxBURST signals are present.

Fixed_Burst_Disable
A Burst type of FIXED is not commonly used, and a property Fixed_Burst_Disable is defined in Table A4.11 to
indicate if a component supports it.
It's not compatible if Fixed burst is not supported in Subordinate but is possible generated by connected manager.

A4.1.5 Transfer address
The protocol supports communication between components that have different physical address space sizes.
Components with different physical address space sizes must communicate as follows:
• The component with the smaller physical address space must be positioned within an aligned window in the
larger physical address space. Typically, the window is located at the bottom of the larger physical address
space. However, it is acceptable for the component with the smaller physical address space to be positioned
in an offset window within the larger physical address space.
• An outgoing transaction must have the required additional higher-order bits added to the transaction address.
• An incoming transaction must be examined so that:
– A transaction that is within the address window has the higher-order address bits removed and is passed
through.
– A transaction that does not have the required higher-order address bits is suppressed.

A4.1.8 Regular transactions
The Regular attribute is defined, to identify transactions which meet the following criteria:
• Length is 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 transfers.
• Size is the same as the data channel width if Length is greater than 1.
• Burst is INCR or WRAP, not FIXED.
• Address is aligned to the transaction container for INCR transactions.
• Address is aligned to Size for WRAP transactions.

A4.2 Write and read data
A4.2.1 Write strobes
There is one write strobe for each 8 bits of the write data channel, therefore WSTRB[n] corresponds to
WDATA[(8n)+7:(8n)].
When WVALID is HIGH:
• Data bytes to be written have a corresponding write strobe set HIGH.
• Inside of the transaction container any number of write strobes can be HIGH. If all write strobes are LOW,
no data is written from that transfer.
• Outside of the transaction container all write strobes must be LOW.
When WVALID is LOW, the write strobes can take any value, although it is recommended that they are either
driven LOW or held at their previous value.
The property WSTRB_Present is used to indicate if the WSTRB signal is present on an interface.

A4.2.4 Unaligned transfers
For any transaction that is made up of data transfers wider than 1 byte, the first
bytes accessed might be unaligned with the natural address boundary.
A Manager can:
• Use the low-order address lines to signal an unaligned start address.
• Provide an aligned address and use the byte lane strobes to signal the unaligned start address.
The Subordinate is not required to take special action based on any alignment information from the Manager.

A4.3 Transaction response
Every AXI transaction includes one or more response transfers sent by the Subordinate to indicate the result of the
transaction.
A4.3.1 Write response
Write responses are transported using the BRESP signal on the write response channel.
The BRESP and BCOMP signals are used to send write responses.
BRESP is an optional signal. If the BRESP_WIDTH property is 0, it is not present and assumed to be 0b000
(OKAY).
BCOMP is only present if an interface is using a feature that can have two write responses, these are:
• Cache maintenance for Persistence, see A10.8 CMOs for Persistence.
• Memory Tagging, see A13.2 Memory Tagging Extension (MTE).

A4.3.2 Read response
The read response indicates if the read was successful and whether the data in that transfer is valid.
Read responses are transported using the RRESP signal on the read data channel. There is a read response with
every read data transfer in a transaction. The response value is not required to be the same for every read data
transfer in a transaction.
